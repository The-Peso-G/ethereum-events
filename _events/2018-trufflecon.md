## FAQ

### Who is TruffleCon for?

TruffleCon is a software developer-focused conference, with a focus on the Truffle suite of tools. So if you are familiar with Ethereum development, you would be a good fit for the conference. You don't need to be an expert though; we welcome all experience levels!

### Who is TruffleCon not for?

Since this is a software conference, the focus is not on cryptocurrency, token sales, or other financial transactions. There are plenty of other conferences for this type of content though, and we wish you the best of luck.
