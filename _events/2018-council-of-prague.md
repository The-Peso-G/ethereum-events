The Council of Prague is the third gathering of the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians. It is being held before [DevCon4](https://devcon4.ethereum.org).

Unlike Berlin, the core will not only be unconference style. Ring Makers and EIP authors will be invited to set aside chunks of time (2 - 3 hours) to work together in moving issues forward. This also is very specifically different than content at DevCon â€“ we gather to make progress on EIPs/ERCs. This may be pair programming, plugfests for interoperability testing, whiteboarding, circle discussions, or anything else that moves towards running code and rough consensus.

Please visit the [Wiki Agenda](https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/wiki/Council-of-Prague-Agenda) to help us build the schedule, and if you wish to publicly list your attendance.
