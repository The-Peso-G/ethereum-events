The Council of Prague is the third gathering of the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians. It is being held before [DevCon4](https://devcon4.ethereum.org).

Unlike Berlin, the core will not only be unconference style. Ring Makers and EIP authors will be invited to set aside chunks of time (2 - 3 hours) to work together in moving issues forward. This also is very specifically different than content at DevCon â€“ we gather to make progress on EIPs/ERCs. This may be pair programming, plugfests for interoperability testing, whiteboarding, circle discussions, or anything else that moves towards running code and rough consensus.

Please visit the [Wiki Agenda](https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/wiki/Council-of-Prague-Agenda) to help us build the schedule, and if you wish to publicly list your attendance.

## Updates

### August 31st, 2018: ChronoLogic provides in-kind sponsorship for video coverage & editing

Joseph from the [ChronoLogic](https://chronologic.network/) team reached out to offer in-kind sponsorship by providing the video coverage and editing services.

ChronoLogic has done video coverage of many events Ethereum-related events including EDCON Toronto, EthCC Paris, DappCon Berlin, ENS Workshop London, etc. You can check out their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTAH_8hSgbzd8Mq84zMsZJQ/videos) for a taste of what they've done in the past.

The ChronoLogic team is currently working on Ethereum scheduling protocols and will be launching the Ethereum Alarm Clock transaction scheduling functionality on the MyCrypto wallet very soon.

We don't yet have a livestream setup. From Berlin, it seemed like there were very few live participants, but we got lots of feedback that people appreciated and watched the videos after the fact. Want to volunteer to run the livestream? Get in touch!

### August 29th, 2018: Ethereum Community Fund signs up as Sustaining Sponsor

We're pleased to announce that the [Ethereum Community Fund (ECF)](https://ecf.network) will be sponsoring and collaborating with the Ethereum Magicians. We met with the ECF team in Berlin in July and had a great discussion about how the ECF could be a long term partner. From that conversation, the ECF is offering its support as a **Sustaining Sponsor**, and will contribute an equivalent of $5K USD of sponsorship for the next three Magicians' events, starting with Prague.

The Ethereum Magicians events are currently all volunteer organized and aim to be low cost. Major costs for events are usually venue, food, and video coverage. We rely on Host Organizations in locations where Councils are held to help with payment, and then organize ETH and fiat sponsorships to cover expenses. The ECF Sustaining Sponsorship will allow us to plan ahead for the Spring and Summer events of 2019, and have a great event in Prague.

Interested in sponsoring? The [Wiki Agenda](https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/wiki/Council-of-Prague-Agenda) lists costs and sponsorship opportunities.
